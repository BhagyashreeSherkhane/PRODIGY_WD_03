This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to play against an AI opponent, making it an engaging and interactive experience. The game follows the traditional 3x3 grid format, where players take turns marking a cell with either "X" or "O". The objective is to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game.
